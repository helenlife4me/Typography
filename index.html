				<b>Why good Typography is Crucial</b><br />Today, we live in a culture
				where everything is visually driven. People tend to be more visually
				inclined these days. Even those who are not adept in Typography can
				sense the subtle differences between a well utilized Type and one that
				is used recklessly. People have become so visually inclined that even
				thought they can’t explain why they have a negative impression about a
				design, they can still feel that there’s something off about it. Many
				big companies spend millions of dollars, trying to formulate the right
				corporate identity and typographic branding. Why? Because they recognize
				Typography’s most important aspect; it’s personality. Because of
				typography’s personality, it is able to make an impression. Just like a
				human being, typography’s various types can incite an emotional reaction
				from the viewer. Therefore, it is safe to say that in every situation, a
				clean, good and well utilized typography can make a huge difference. The
				Influence of Type Type is crucial because it is the conveyor of
				information. It is a mode of delivery that does more than convey. Good
				type choices can also improve the message it conveys, making it more
				accessible and readable to the viewer.
			</p>

			<p>
				<i
					>Typography is all about looks; the visual aspect. Type’s primary aim
					is to visually convey its message.</i
				>
				Let’s discuss examples that show how type can mean the difference
				between life and death. Two common examples are Prescription medicine
				prints and Roadside Signage. Roadside Signage has to be clear and
				legible enough so that it can be read by the passing motorists. Not only
				should the letterform be clear and legible, it must also be large enough
				that it can be read by a motorist going at 60 miles an hour and from a
				particular distance. Both of these are crucial so that one can make
				timely decisions on the road. In addition to the aforementioned,
				letterforms should also be readable under adverse environmental
				conditions. Imagine that you’re driving along the highway at night,
				going 60 miles an hour while it is raining hard. The information on the
				highway signage must be clear, large and legible to the driver even
				during worst conditions. Putting a clear and large letterform on a
				roadside signage could mean the difference between a roadside accident
				and driving home safely. The next example is the print on a Prescription
				medicine bottle. We’ve all seen how tiny prescription medicine bottle
				prints are. These tiny bottle prints are often the reason why some
				people take the wrong medicine.
			</p>

			<p>
				Many people are having a hard time reading the small print, especially
				for older people who are visually impaired. Because of this dilemma, a
				graphic designer named Deb Adler was motivated to remake the letterforms
				on prescription medicine bottles. She wanted to make them more legible
				and easy to understand after her grandmother mistakenly took the wrong
				medicine and became seriously ill. She redesigned the whole labeling
				scheme, increased the size of the type and utilized a much clearer
				typestyle. After implementing the redesigned labeling scheme, the number
				of people who take the wrong medicine because of misreading the label
				was drastically reduced. It is clear that correct typographic usage
				could mean the difference between life and death. Contrary to what some
				people are saying, good type utilization is not just about artistic
				taste. Correct type usage is a matter of legible and strong
				communication.<br />
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Typographic relativity</b><br />
				There’s a vital typography concept that many novice and non-novice
				graphic designer should know about. It is called the role of proper
				proportions. Most people also know this as the Typographic Relativity
				theory. The Typographic relativity theory basically applies to each and
				every design that is created using type. It discusses the correlation
				and interaction between each and every typographic element. An extremely
				successful graphic design has many parts and those parts are all related
				to one another. Just imagine for a second that you are going through a
				recipe to prepare a meal. If you decide to change the proportion of one
				of the main ingredients in the recipe, logic dictates that you have to
				change the proportions of the other ingredients as well.
			</p>

			<p>
				A recipe’s overall taste is determined by the correlation of all of its
				ingredients to one another. Looking at it outside the box, each
				ingredient has a significant impact on every other ingredient in a
				recipe. Another great example would be the feeling that you obtain when
				you enter an exquisitely designed room or area. You get a sense of great
				comfort from the proper allocation of space in a room. In addition, the
				room’s various elements such as color, surface, shape, accessories,
				lighting and furnishing all appear to go together harmoniously. It is
				not by chance, nor is it by accident. It is the overall result of proper
				decision-making and getting a grasp of how each and every aspect
				interact with each other. Typography is like that as well. Various
				typographic elements correlate with one another. They must strike a
				balance with one another in terms of size, position, weight and
				orientation. On top of that, typographic elements such as colors,
				styles, etc. must be balanced so as to communicate the design’s intended
				message to the viewer. Remember, everything in your design project
				exists in relation to all other aspects. That is what the Typographic
				Relativity Theory is all about.

					>Type Classification<br /><br />
					A basic system for classifying typefaces was devised in the nineteenth
					century, when printers sought to identify a heritage for their own
					craft analogous to that of art history. Humanist letterforms are
					closely connected to calligraphy and the movement of the hand.
					Transitional and modern typefaces are more abstract and less organic.
					<br /><br />These three main groups correspond roughly to the
					Renaissance, Baroque, and Enlightenment periods in art and literature.
					Historians and critics of typography have since proposed more finely
					grained schemes that attempt to better capture the diversity of
					letterforms. <br /><br /><i
						>Designers in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries have
						continued to create new typefaces based on historic
						characteristics.</i

					in order to comply with Unicode, an international system for
					identifying all of the world’s recognized writing systems. Only a
					symbol with a unique function is considered a character and is thus
					assigned a code point in Unicode. A single character, such as a
					lowercase a, can be embodied by several different glyphs (a, a, a).
					Each glyph is a specific expression of a given character. Roman or
					roman? <br /><br />The Roman Empire is a proper noun and thus is

					Some come loaded with your computer’s operating system, while others
					are bundled with software packages. A few of these widely distributed
					typefaces are of the highest quality, such as Adobe Garamond Pro and
					Hoefler Text, while others (including Comic Sans, Apple Chancery, and
					Papyrus) are reviled by design snobs everywhere.
					<br /><br />If you want to expand your vocabulary beyond this familiar
					fare, you will need to purchase fonts from digital type foundries.
					These range from large establishments like Adobe and FontShop, which
					license thousands of different typefaces, to independent producers
					that distribute just a few, such as Underware in the Netherlands or
					Jeremy Tankard Typography in the U.K. <br /><br />You can also learn
					to make your own fonts as well as find fonts that are distributed for

				<b>Scale</b> is the size of design elements in comparison to other
				elements in a layout as well as to the physical context of the work.
				Scale is relative. 12-pt type displayed on a 32-inch monitor can look
				very small, while 12-pt type printed on a book page can look flabby and
				overweight. Designers create hierarchy and contrast by playing with the
				scale of letterforms. Changes in scale help create visual contrast,

				for emphatic differences rather than mushy transitions. Give each
				ingredient a role to play: sweet tomatoes, crunchy cucumbers, and the
				pungent shock of an occasional anchovy. When mixing typefaces on the
				same line, designers usually adjust the point size so that the x-heights
				align. When placing typefaces on separate lines, it often makes sense to
				create contrast in scale as well as style or weight. Try mixing big,
				light type with small, dark type for a criss-cross of contrasting

				modern business. Lining numerals are the same height as capital letters,
				so they sometimes look big and bulky when appearing in running text.
				Non-lining numerals, also called text or old style numerals, have
				ascenders and descenders, like lowercase letters. Non-lining numerals
				returned to favor in the 1990s, valued for their idiosyncratic

				old style numerals are proportional; each one has its own set width.

						>In Typography, there exist two basic categories of letterforms.
						These are Serif and Sans Serif. Let’s discuss the distinction
						between the two styles. Serifs Serifs are the most common type of
						letters. They are characterized by little feet or extenders. The one
						aspect that is prevalent among them is that they’re all Serif
						letterforms or typefaces. Another discernible characteristic of a
						Serif typeface is the serif at the bottom of the letters called
						footers. Let us now take a closer look at the Sans Serif. In
						contrast to Serifs, Sans Serifs are letters without the little feet.
						Sans is basically a French word for “without”. Therefore, Sans Serif
						means without Serifs; without feet. In the graphic design world,
						Sans Serifs are just called “Sans” for short.</b

				</p>
				<p class="serifP2">
					One common thing exists between them, however, and that is they don’t
					have feet; no serifs. So now you possess the expansive stokes of type
					categorization. We will do an in-depth discussion on type
					categorization as we go along in this book. There are tens upon
					thousands of typeface variations in each of these categories that are
					readily available from many font foundries and type sellers out there.
					You’d be amazed that even graphic design veterans aren’t even familiar

							Being able to distinguish between Display Type and Text type is
							crucial in typography. Here’s what you need to keep in mind.
							<b>Text Type</b><br />
							Text type is a type of letterform that is specifically made to be
							read at small sizes in large quantities. This is the type of text
							that you would normally see comprising the paragraph of an article
							or document. The bulk of text that you will find in any magazine,
							book, newspaper, brochure, etc. is Text type. Another common term
							for Text type is Body Copy or Body Type. The typical size of a
							Text Type is around 8 to 10 point size. There are certain
							applications where the Text Type point size is 12. Text type point
							sizes will again depend on the typeface being used. Due to its
							small size, Text types have to be very easy to read.</b

					</p>
					<p>
						During the 1930s, a very famous typographer named Beatrice Ward
						wrote a remarkable essay about text typography. In this essay, she
						metaphorically related a crystal goblet to typesetting. She stated
						that the goblet should be clear as crystal in order for the content
						to be seen first, instead of the goblet itself. The main point of
						her essay was clarity in typesetting makes the content easy to
						acknowledge, implying that typography or printing should be
						inconspicuous. The goal is to have a smooth reading experience. When
						we’re in the process of reading, things may seem seamless. But in
						actuality, we depend on countless small visual cues to assist us in
						absorbing the words and small blocks of text in a fraction of a
						second. Letterforms need not be an obstacle in this seamless reading
						process. Letterforms need to be clear and legible so that the reader
						makes no conscious effort whatsoever to acknowledge the shapes of
						the letters. Text typefaces, which are designed to be read in huge
						volumes in minute sizes, share some common important traits.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="serif2P2">

						<b>
							Looking at the examples below of common Text typefaces, you will
							notice that each type has open spaces inside the letters. Each
							letter body height is tall, compared to the capital letters. They
							are of medium weight and exhibit repetitive and rhythmic outlines.
							Due to the aforementioned characteristics and details, the letters
							are easy to distinguish. Most text typefaces of today are just
							digitized versions of typefaces that have been used hundreds of
							years ago because they work absolutely well to this day. The first
							three typeface illustrated above are good examples of these. In
							contrast, Display Type is a type of letterform that is designed to
							be read in small quantities at large sizes. Display Type is
							usually 14 point or larger and is commonly used for effect and
							emphasis.</b
						>
					</p>
					<p>
						Most of the 200,000 readily available typefaces are Display Types.
						They are used in almost all design projects today. Display Type is
						the total opposite of Text Type. It relies on its uncommon form to
						denote and extend its content. Unlike its Text Type counterpart,
						Display Type is not designed to be inconspicuous; invisible. It is
						designed to catch attention. In the vast pool of various typefaces
						available out there, there exist a specific Display Type for every
						possible use. For example, if you’re looking for typefaces that
						resemble handwriting, tens of thousands of typefaces are readily
						available. A few examples of these are illustrated below. There is
						one other important thing to remember between Text Type and Display
						Type. With Text type, they can be converted into Display Type by
						making their point size larger. Display Types, however, cannot be
						reduced in size to function as Text Type.

							>Classifications of Types In this chapter, we’re going to take a
							closer look at some details and shapes that will assist us in
							classifying typefaces, apart from just serif and sans serif. All
							currently recognizable typefaces belong to a known tradition. In
							order for graphic designers to make knowledgeable decisions about
							correct typeface utilization, we have to pinpoint typefaces
							according to their historical backgrounds. Despite not having a
							single all-encompassing system of type classification, we would
							like to familiarize you to the basic and most widely identified
							classifications of type. The first and the most basic serif type
							are called Oldstyle. Oldstyle, which is of Roman origin, was
							created somewhere between the late 15th century and middle 18th
							century.</b
						>
					</p>
					<p class="serifPP1">
						Oldstyle typefaces have noticeably long descenders and ascenders.
						Descenders and Ascenders are letterform parts that stretch beyond
						the top and bottom of the body height. In addition, the spaces
						within the body of each letter are small. The second most basic
						category of type is called Transitional. The Transitional typeface
						serves as an eloquent link between the Oldstyle typeface and the
						next typeface class called Modern. The most discernible
						characteristic of Transitional typeface is their tighter bracketed
						curve. In addition, the stress of each curved letter is more
						vertical. You will also observe the imaginary line that connects the
						thinnest parts of the letter “O” called the stress.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="serifPPP">
					<p class="serifPPP1">
						<b>
							There exists a higher contrast between the thin and thick strokes
							of a Transitional typeface. During the mid 18th century, advances
							in font and print technology led to the change in typeface
							appearance from Oldstyle to Transitional. During the late 18th
							century, Modern typefaces made their initial debut. Modern
							typefaces are easy to spot. Notice the existing contrast between
							the slim and wide strokes and the excessively thin unbracketed
							serifs, which are horizontal. The third major basic serif type is
							Slab Serif. It too emerged during the mid 18th century. Because of
							the Slab Serif’s strong presence and weight, they were mainly used
							for signage and advertising.</b
						><br /><br />
						You will notice that with the Slab Serif, the serifs are also
						basically unbracketed. In addition, Slab Serifs exhibit inadequate
						contrast between strokes. What that means is that the thicks and
						thins of the strokes are of equal weight. Refusing to be outdone by
						the other Serif types, Sans Serif typefaces also matured to
						accommodate the needs of advertising. This maturity or evolution
						brought about three main classifications of Sans Serif typefaces:
						Grotesque – Gothic is another term by which Grotesque goes by. They
						exhibit modest disparities in stroke width. Looking closely at
						Grotesque or Gothic sans serif, you will notice that the letters are
						adequately spacious and the rounded letters are a little bit squared
						off.
					</p>
					<p class="serifPPP2">
						<b>
							Humanist Sans Serif – This type of Sans Serif have a
							characteristically distinct classical Roman letter proportion.
							Upon closer scrutiny, you’ll notice some of the dimensions of the
							hand-lettered Roman forms. Geometric Sans Serif – Out of the three
							categories of Sans serif, the Geometric Sans Serif is the easiest
							to detect. This is due to the basic geometric forms it is based
							off, which is the circle, triangle and square. Geometric Sans
							Serif resonate the modernistic movement of the 20th century. Some
							of the widely known Geometric Sans Serif are the Avant-Garde,
							Kable and Futura.</b
						>
						<br /><br />Today, newly created typefaces that follow the design
						pattern of a type classification are also included under that
						particular category. These types of typefaces are commonly known as
						Revivals. Remember, understanding the various type classification
						will definitely help you select which kind of typeface to utilize
						for your graphic design project. Now, were going t o take a look at
						some types of typefaces that don’t fit perfectly into the
						aforementioned classification categories. These typefaces are all
						Display Type. Therefore, keep in mind that they should only be
						utilized at bigger sizes and in minute quantities. There are
						basically two typefaces that fall under the “other” category:
						Scripts – This typeface is easy to distinguish because of its
						popularity.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="serif4P">
					<p class="serif4P1">
						<b>
							Scripts are letterforms that are based off of handwritten letters.
							The main thing people notice about scripts is that they are linked
							to one another with connecting strokes. Below are some common
							examples of scripts that vary from being informal to very formal.
							One type of script that many designers use in their design project
							is the Bickham Script. It is preferred by many designers because
							it is exquisitely elegant. In addition, its character set is also
							comprised of hundreds alternate flourishes. Looking at the example
							illustration below, the Bickham script has 15 possible variations
							of the letter H in lowercase. Scripts are very famous, hence they
							can be seen everywhere. There are informal scripts that may look
							like brush written or handwritten letterforms.</b
						><br /><br />
						Today, there exists hundreds if not thousands of wonderful scripts
						with varying degrees of fluidity, alternate characters and weight.
						There are scripts that can also be tricky to use. An example of this
						is the Zapfino script. They are tricky to use because they sometimes
						have huge swashes which can get twisted up when lines are
						unsymmetrical. Blackletter or Fraktur – This is the other typeface
						that falls under the “other” classification. As you can see from the
						illustration below, this typeface does indeed look like they are
						broken or fractured. Their fractured or broken look can be
						attributed to the individual strokes that comprise each letter in
						this typeface. Similar to scripts, Blackletters or Frakturs also
						have an array of typefaces to choose from.
					</p>
					<p class="serif4P2">
						<b>
							Among the hundreds of Blackletter typeface variations in
							existence, the Fette Faktur is what most graphic designers favor.
							The spiky nature of the letters in this typeface is the reason why
							some people call this letterform Old English. In the example
							illustration below, you will see why these typefaces are given the
							name Blackletter. Looking at the illustration above, Blackletters
							are called as such because they possess a weighty appearance,
							there is little to no space between individual letters, the spaces
							within each letter is very minimal and the spacing between each
							line is extremely tight. Because of this, their overall hue on the
							page is black.</b
						><br /><br />
						Beyond Scripts and Blackletters, there exists a plethora of
						ornamental and decorative typefaces that were created to accommodate
						the needs of promotion, advertising and brand identity. Some of
						these outrageous and extraordinary typeface styles justify
						categorization. Many typography veterans regard Display typography
						as having a volatile nature, similar to the unpredictable winds of
						fashion. Skimming through the never-ending type choices available
						today might prove to be a daunting task. However, the more you look
						at type with a savvy and keen eye, the more knowledgeable your view
						becomes. In the end, you will establish a deeper perception of what
						to search for. This will definitely help you acquire a display
						typeface that will match your particular needs.
