				Why good Typography is Crucial
			</h2>
			<p>
				Today, we live in a culture where everything is visually driven. People
				tend to be more visually inclined these days. Even those who are not
				adept in Typography can sense the subtle differences between a well
				utilized Type and one that is used recklessly. People have become so
				visually inclined that even thought they can’t explain why they have a
				negative impression about a design, they can still feel that there’s
				something off about it. Many big companies spend millions of dollars,
				trying to formulate the right corporate identity and typographic
				branding. Why? Because they recognize Typography’s most important
				aspect; it’s personality. Because of typography’s personality, it is
				able to make an impression. Just like a human being, typography’s
				various types can incite an emotional reaction from the viewer.
				Therefore, it is safe to say that in every situation, a clean, good and
				well utilized typography can make a huge difference. The Influence of
				Type Type is crucial because it is the conveyor of information. It is a
				mode of delivery that does more than convey. Good type choices can also
				improve the message it conveys, making it more accessible and readable
				to the viewer.
			</p>

					is to visually convey its message.</b

				Let’s discuss examples that show how type can mean the difference
				between life and death. Two common examples are Prescription medicine
				prints and Roadside Signage. Roadside Signage has to be clear and
				legible enough so that it can be read by the passing motorists. Not only
				should the letterform be clear and legible, it must also be large enough
				that it can be read by a motorist going at 60 miles an hour and from a
				particular distance. Both of these are crucial so that one can make
				timely decisions on the road. In addition to the aforementioned,
				letterforms should also be readable under adverse environmental
				conditions. Imagine that you’re driving along the highway at night,
				going 60 miles an hour while it is raining hard. The information on the
				highway signage must be clear, large and legible to the driver even
				during worst conditions. Putting a clear and large letterform on a
				roadside signage could mean the difference between a roadside accident
				and driving home safely. The next example is the print on a Prescription
				medicine bottle. We’ve all seen how tiny prescription medicine bottle
				prints are. These tiny bottle prints are often the reason why some
				people take the wrong medicine.
			</p>

			<p>
				Many people are having a hard time reading the small print, especially
				for older people who are visually impaired. Because of this dilemma, a
				graphic designer named Deb Adler was motivated to remake the letterforms
				on prescription medicine bottles. She wanted to make them more legible
				and easy to understand after her grandmother mistakenly took the wrong
				medicine and became seriously ill. She redesigned the whole labeling
				scheme, increased the size of the type and utilized a much clearer
				typestyle. After implementing the redesigned labeling scheme, the number
				of people who take the wrong medicine because of misreading the label
				was drastically reduced. It is clear that correct typographic usage
				could mean the difference between life and death. Contrary to what some
				people are saying, good type utilization is not just about artistic
				taste. Correct type usage is a matter of legible and strong
				communication.<br />
			</p>

			<h2><b>Typographic relativity</b></h2>
			<p>
				There’s a vital typography concept that many novice and non-novice
				graphic designer should know about. It is called the role of proper
				proportions. Most people also know this as the Typographic Relativity
				theory. The Typographic relativity theory basically applies to each and
				every design that is created using type. It discusses the correlation
				and interaction between each and every typographic element. An extremely
				successful graphic design has many parts and those parts are all related
				to one another. Just imagine for a second that you are going through a
				recipe to prepare a meal. If you decide to change the proportion of one
				of the main ingredients in the recipe, logic dictates that you have to
				change the proportions of the other ingredients as well.
			</p>

			<p>
				A recipe’s overall taste is determined by the correlation of all of its
				ingredients to one another. Looking at it outside the box, each
				ingredient has a significant impact on every other ingredient in a
				recipe. Another great example would be the feeling that you obtain when
				you enter an exquisitely designed room or area. You get a sense of great
				comfort from the proper allocation of space in a room. In addition, the
				room’s various elements such as color, surface, shape, accessories,
				lighting and furnishing all appear to go together harmoniously. It is
				not by chance, nor is it by accident. It is the overall result of proper
				decision-making and getting a grasp of how each and every aspect
				interact with each other. Typography is like that as well. Various
				typographic elements correlate with one another. They must strike a
				balance with one another in terms of size, position, weight and
				orientation. On top of that, typographic elements such as colors,
				styles, etc. must be balanced so as to communicate the design’s intended
				message to the viewer. Remember, everything in your design project
				exists in relation to all other aspects. That is what the Typographic
				Relativity Theory is all about.

				<b>Type Classification</b><br /><br />
				A basic system for classifying typefaces was devised in the nineteenth
				century, when printers sought to identify a heritage for their own craft
				analogous to that of art history. Humanist letterforms are closely
				connected to calligraphy and the movement of the hand. Transitional and
				modern typefaces are more abstract and less organic. <br /><br />These
				three main groups correspond roughly to the Renaissance, Baroque, and
				Enlightenment periods in art and literature. Historians and critics of
				typography have since proposed more finely grained schemes that attempt
				to better capture the diversity of letterforms. <br /><br /><i
					>Designers in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries have continued
					to create new typefaces based on historic characteristics.</i
				>
			</p>

			<p class="secondP">
				<b>Typeface or font?</b><br /><br />A typeface is the design of the
				letterforms; a font is the delivery mechanism. In metal type, the design
				is embodied in the punches from which molds are made. A font consists of
				the cast metal printing types.<br /><br />
				In digital systems, the typeface is the visual design, while the font is
				the software that allows you to install, access, and output the design.
				A single typeface might be available in several font formats. In part
				because the design of digital typefaces and the production of fonts are
				so fluidly linked today, most people use the terms interchangeably.
				<br /><br />Type nerds insist, however, on using them precisely.
				character or glyph? Type designers distinguish characters from glyphs in
				order to comply with Unicode, an international system for identifying
				all of the world’s recognized writing systems. Only a symbol with a
				unique function is considered a character and is thus assigned a code
				point in Unicode. A single character, such as a lowercase a, can be
				embodied by several different glyphs (a, a, a). Each glyph is a specific
				expression of a given character. Roman or roman? <br /><br />The Roman
				Empire is a proper noun and thus is capitalized, but we identify roman
				letterforms, like italic ones, in lowercase. The name of the Latin
				alphabet is capitalized.

					>Font Formats. Where do fonts come from, and why are there so many
					different formats?<br /><br
				/></b>
				Some come loaded with your computer’s operating system, while others are
				bundled with software packages. A few of these widely distributed
				typefaces are of the highest quality, such as Adobe Garamond Pro and
				Hoefler Text, while others (including Comic Sans, Apple Chancery, and
				Papyrus) are reviled by design snobs everywhere. <br /><br />If you want
				to expand your vocabulary beyond this familiar fare, you will need to
				purchase fonts from digital type foundries. These range from large
				establishments like Adobe and FontShop, which license thousands of
				different typefaces, to independent producers that distribute just a
				few, such as Underware in the Netherlands or Jeremy Tankard Typography
				in the U.K. <br /><br />You can also learn to make your own fonts as
				well as find fonts that are distributed for free online. The different
				font formats reflect technical innovations and business arrangements
				developed over time. Older font formats are still generally usable on
				modern operating systems. A typeface is the design of the letterforms; a

				<b>Scale</b> is the size of design elements in comparison to other
				elements in a layout as well as to the physical context of the work.
				Scale is relative. 12-pt type displayed on a 32-inch monitor can look
				very small, while 12-pt type printed on a book page can look flabby and
				overweight. Designers create hierarchy and contrast by playing with the
				scale of letterforms. Changes in scale help create visual contrast,
				movement, and depth as well as express hierarchies of importance. Scale
				is physical. People intuitively judge the size of objects in relation to
				their own bodies and environments.

				<b>Superfamilies</b> A traditional roman book face typically has a small
				family–an intimate group consisting of roman, italic, small caps, and
				possibly bold and semibold (each with an italic variant) styles.
				Sans-serif families often come in many more weights and sizes, such as
				thin, light, black, compressed, and condensed. A superfamily consists of
				dozens of related fonts in multiple weights and/or widths, often with
				both sans-serif and serif versions. Small capitals and non-lining
				numerals (once found only in serif fonts) are included in the sans-serif
				versions of Thesis, Scala Pro, and many other contemporary
				superfamilies.

				<b>Caps and Small Caps.</b> A word set in ALL CAPS within running text
				can look big and bulky, and A LONG PASSAGE SET ENTIRELY IN CAPITALS CAN
				LOOK UTTERLY INSANE. Small capitals are designed to match the x-height
				of lowercase letters. Designers, enamored with the squarish proportions
				of true small caps, employ them not only within bodies of text but for
				subheads, bylines, invitations, and more. Rather than Mixing Small Caps
				with Capitals, many designers prefer to use all small caps, creating a
				clean line with no ascending elements. InDesign and other programs allow
				users to create FALSE SMALL CAPS at the press of a button; these SCRAWNY
				LETTERS look out of place.

				<b>Mixing Typefaces.</b> Combining typefaces is like making a salad.
				Start with a small number of elements representing different colors,
				tastes, and textures. Strive for contrast rather than harmony, looking
				for emphatic differences rather than mushy transitions. Give each
				ingredient a role to play: sweet tomatoes, crunchy cucumbers, and the
				pungent shock of an occasional anchovy. When mixing typefaces on the
				same line, designers usually adjust the point size so that the x-heights
				align. When placing typefaces on separate lines, it often makes sense to
				create contrast in scale as well as style or weight. Try mixing big,
				light type with small, dark type for a criss-cross of contrasting
				flavors and textures.

				<b>Punctuation Lining numerals</b> take up uniform widths of space,
				enabling the numbers to line up when tabulated in columns. They were
				introduced around the turn of the twentieth century to meet the needs of
				modern business. Lining numerals are the same height as capital letters,
				so they sometimes look big and bulky when appearing in running text.
				Non-lining numerals, also called text or old style numerals, have
				ascenders and descenders, like lowercase letters. Non-lining numerals
				returned to favor in the 1990s, valued for their idiosyncratic
				appearance and their traditional typographic attitude. Like letterforms,
				old style numerals are proportional; each one has its own set width.
